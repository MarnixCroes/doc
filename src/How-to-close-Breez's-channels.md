# How to close channels in Breez?

In order to close payment channels in Breez, click through **Preferences > Developers > Channels > closeallchannels**.
Funds that were contained in those channels will be available in the Breez app once the closing transactions are confirmed on-chain.
 
**Warning**: funds will only be available for redemption if the balance exceeds the on-chain transaction cost.
